# CS50P - Harvard's Introduction to Programming with Python 🐍

This repository contains my complete solutions to Harvard University's [CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/) course problem sets.

## 📖 About the Course

CS50P is Harvard's introduction to programming using Python, covering fundamental programming concepts and practical applications. Each week builds upon previous knowledge with hands-on problem-solving exercises.

## 🚧 Work in Progress

This repository is actively updated as I progress through the course. New solutions are pushed daily as I complete each problem set.

## 🎯 What I'm Learning

As I progress through CS50P, I'm developing skills in:
- Core Python programming concepts
- Problem-solving and algorithmic thinking
- Code testing and debugging
- File handling and data processing
- Object-oriented design principles

## 📋 Academic Integrity

All solutions in this repository are my original work, completed independently for educational purposes. If you're currently taking CS50P:

> ⚠️ **Please complete the assignments yourself first before referencing these solutions. Academic integrity is fundamental to learning.**

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository

1. **For Current Students**: Use this as a reference after attempting problems yourself
2. **For Self-Learners**: Compare your solutions and explore different approaches
3. **For Reviewers**: Understand my problem-solving methodology and coding style

## 📈 Current Progress

Solutions are added daily as I work through each week's problem sets. Check back regularly for updates!
